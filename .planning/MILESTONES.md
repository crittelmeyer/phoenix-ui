# Project Milestones: Phoenix Design System

## v1 Phoenix Design System Monorepo Starter (Shipped: 2026-02-02)

**Delivered:** A clone-and-go monorepo starter with 14 UI components, design token pipeline, Storybook docs, and AI-first guardrails enabling Claude Code to add components autonomously.

**Phases completed:** 1-6 (18 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Monorepo scaffold with pnpm + Turborepo, zero-config clone-and-run
- DTCG token system with OKLCH colors, light/dark themes, and Style Dictionary pipeline
- 14 production-ready Radix UI components with CVA variants and semantic tokens
- Storybook 8.6 documentation with Figma Code Connect scaffolding
- AI integration layer: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, path-scoped .claude/rules/
- Validated AI autonomy: Claude added Accordion component from documentation alone

**Stats:**

- 167 files created/modified
- 5,413 lines of TypeScript/CSS/JSON
- 6 phases, 18 plans, 86 commits
- 2 days (2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02)

**Git range:** `c54a765` (docs: initialize project) → `85efb2d` (fix(storybook): add argTypes)

**What's next:** v2 enhanced components (Avatar, Badge, Card, Sheet, Popover, Command) and tooling (visual regression, changesets, CI/CD)
