<objective>
Create a migration guide documenting how to move from the seed token JSON files to Tokens Studio or Figma Variables for designer-developer workflow.

Purpose: Satisfies TOKN-07 (documented migration path). Ensures the token system isn't a dead end -- designers can connect their tools to the same token source.

Output: docs/token-migration.md with step-by-step migration instructions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write token migration guide</name>
  <files>docs/token-migration.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/token-migration.md` covering:

**1. Overview section:**

- Explain the current token architecture (DTCG format JSON files processed by Style Dictionary)
- Why DTCG format was chosen (industry standard, tool interoperability)
- Two migration paths: Tokens Studio (Figma plugin) and native Figma Variables

**2. Current Token Architecture:**

- List the seed files and their purposes (colors.json, spacing.json, etc.)
- Explain the DTCG format ($value, $type, $description)
- Show how Style Dictionary transforms these into CSS custom properties
- Note the semantic token layer (aliases referencing scale values)

**3. Migration Path A: Tokens Studio**

- What Tokens Studio is (Figma plugin for design token management)
- Steps to connect: install plugin, point to repo's token directory, configure sync
- How DTCG format maps to Tokens Studio's internal model
- Bidirectional sync: designer changes flow to JSON, developer changes flow to Figma
- Limitations and considerations

**4. Migration Path B: Figma Variables**

- What Figma Variables are (native Figma feature for design tokens)
- Steps: export DTCG tokens to Figma Variables format, import into Figma
- Available tools for DTCG-to-Figma conversion
- One-directional vs bidirectional sync options
- Limitations (Figma Variables feature maturity, limited token types)

**5. Choosing a Path:**

- When to choose Tokens Studio (full DTCG support, bidirectional, mature)
- When to choose Figma Variables (native, simpler, good for color-only)
- When to stay with seed files (no designer, solo developer, AI-first workflow)

Keep it practical and concise. This is a starter kit guide, not exhaustive documentation. Target ~100-150 lines.
</action>
<verify> - `docs/token-migration.md` exists and is well-formatted Markdown - Document covers both Tokens Studio and Figma Variables paths - DTCG format is explained with reference to actual token file structure - Guide has clear headings and is scannable
</verify>
<done>
Migration guide exists at docs/token-migration.md covering Tokens Studio and Figma Variables migration paths from the DTCG seed token files.
</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. docs/token-migration.md exists with substantive content (50+ lines)
2. Both migration paths (Tokens Studio, Figma Variables) documented
3. DTCG format connection to migration explained
4. Practical steps included for each path
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Clear, actionable migration guide exists
- Both Tokens Studio and Figma Variables paths covered
- References actual token file structure from the project
- TOKN-07 requirement satisfied
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-token-system/02-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
